using flex sensors (variable resistors. Resistance value changes when the sensor is bent) to map the movement of fingers. These values will then be used to actuate the servo motors which move the fingers. For the processing unit, we will be using an Arduino Uno. Flex sensors will be made using conductive foils and partially conductive material.
